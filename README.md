# House Price Prediction System (Machine Learning + FastAPI)

## Project Overview

This project is an **end-to-end Machine Learning system** that predicts **house prices** based on neighborhood and housing features such as crime rate, number of rooms, pollution level, and socio-economic factors.

The model is trained on the **Boston Housing Dataset** and deployed using **FastAPI** to provide real-time predictions through a REST API.

This project demonstrates **practical ML engineering skills**, not just model training.

---

## Problem Statement

House prices depend on many factors:

* Crime rate
* Number of rooms
* Location advantages (river proximity)
* Pollution level
* Tax rate
* Socio-economic status

The goal is to **learn patterns from historical data** and predict the **median house value (MEDV)** accurately.

---

## Dataset

* **Source:** Boston Housing Dataset
* **Records:** 506 houses
* **Features:** 13 numerical features
* **Target:** `MEDV` (Median value of owner-occupied homes)

### Feature Description (Simple Meaning)

| Feature | Meaning                      |
| ------- | ---------------------------- |
| CRIM    | Crime rate in area           |
| ZN      | Residential land percentage  |
| INDUS   | Industrial area proportion   |
| CHAS    | Near Charles River (1 = Yes) |
| NOX     | Air pollution level          |
| RM      | Average number of rooms      |
| AGE     | Age of houses                |
| DIS     | Distance to city centers     |
| RAD     | Road accessibility           |
| TAX     | Property tax rate            |
| PTRATIO | Student-teacher ratio        |
| B       | Population demographic score |
| LSTAT   | % of low-income population   |
| MEDV    | House price (Target)         |

## Machine Learning Approach

* **Problem Type:** Regression
* **Algorithm:** Random Forest Regressor
* **Why Random Forest?**

  * Handles non-linear relationships well
  * Robust to outliers
  * Strong performance on tabular data

## Model Performance

| Metric                     | Value |
|----------------------------|-------|
| MAE                        | ~2.06 |
| RMSE                       | ~2.92 |
| R² Score                   | ~0.88 |

✔ Model explains ~88% of price variance <br>
✔ Average prediction error ≈ ±5 price units

This is **solid performance** for this dataset.

## FastAPI Integration

The trained model is exposed via a **REST API** using FastAPI.

### API Features

* Accepts house features as JSON
* Returns predicted house price
* Swagger UI available for testing

### Run the API

```bash
fastapi run main.py
```

Open in browser:
